               faith has centered on the character of the Old Testament and its

               and Jews have parted ways, creating a deep and enduring chasm
               between the two faith communities. With this new volume, Fredrick
               Holmgren aids in closing this hurtful breach by engaging with
               views on both sides of this important conversation. Holmgren
               dialogues with Christians from every point on the theological
               spectrum, urging the church to a new respect for the Jewish
               Bible, the enduring role of the Old Testament as ``Christian
               scripture,'' and the valuable contributions of Judaism to the
               Christian faith. Warning the church against either caricaturing
               the Old Testament and Judaism or romanticizing Christianity,
               Holmgren sensitively shows that the New Testament proclamation of
               newness in Christ carries forward the witness of the Old
               Testament without making obsolete its Jewish interpretation.",

               Lexicographical analysis of the terms designating the addressees

               choice of vineyard construction as the topic of his parable was
               most probably a polemical critique, not a neutral happenstance.
               Under such circumstances, earlier prophetic judgments were
               understood to presage and explain the fall of the monarchic
               nation-states of Israel and Judah. Since the several terms

               Old Testament prophetic books no other equals Isaiah's brilliance
               of style and metaphor, its arresting vision of the Holy One of
               Israel and its kaleidoscopic vision of God's future restoration
               of Israel and the world. Now, after over three decades of
               studying and teaching Isaiah, Alec Motyer presents a wealth of
               commentary and perspective on this book. His emphasis is on the
               grammatical, historical, structural, literary and theological
               dimensions of the text. Though based on the Hebrew text, his
               exposition easily accomodates readers without a working knowledge
               of biblical Hebrew. And he writes with an interest in Isaiah's
               meaning for Christians today. Along the historical timeline on
               which the Isaianic prophecies are strung, Motyer finds three
               central and recurring themes: the messianic hope, the motif of
               the city and the theology of the Holy One of Israel. Moreover, he
               argues, the Isaianic literature is organized around three
               messianic portraits: the King (Isaiah 1-37), the Servant (Isaiah
               38-55) and the Anointed Conqueror (Isaiah 56-66). Preachers,
               teachers and serious Bible students of all types will find this
               commentary a wise, winsome and welcome guide to the prophecy of
               Isaiah. It may easily be the best one-volume evangelical

               reality of change as implied in ideas of creation and redemption?
               Western Trinitarian theology in the 20thcentury tended toward
               emphasizing the significance of change above divine
               unchangeability, giving it a modalist and Hegelian flavour that
               questioned the continuity with the church fathers. For this
               reason, it has been criticized by Orthodox theologians like
               Vladimir Lossky and David Bentley Hart. Newer scholarship has
               shown the significance of Luther's appropriation of the doctrine
               of divine unknowability and his insistence on the difference
               between revelation and divine essence for his understanding of
               the Trinity, which thus may appear to be much closer to the
               position of the Orthodox critics than to the Lutheran theologians
               criticized by them. There thus seems to be an unused potential in
               Luther's doctrine of the Trinity that should be of interest both
               for systematic and ecumenical theology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

               Jesus, earthly or risen, by reason of his union with the
               pre-existent Son or Logos. C) Mark the Hermit, Opusculum XI,

  author    = "Green, Joel B and Baker, Mark D",
  publisher = "InterVarsity Press",
  abstract  = "The cross is the defining symbol of the Christian faith. Yet the
               Roman cross was first and foremost an instrument of cruel,
               shameful and violent execution. Early Christians quickly
               recognized the atoning significance of the cross of Christ, and
               it resonated deeply with their experience of salvation. But the
               cross remained a blessing framed by scandal, an epochal and yet
               mysterious event irreducible to a single formulation. As Joel
               Green and Mark Baker demonstrate, the New Testament displays a
               rich array of interpretations of the cross. These were shaped by
               the church in mission as it rooted the saving story of a
               scandalous cross in the language of everyday realities and
               relationships. But for many Christians today, not only has the
               true scandal of the cross been obscured, the variety of its New
               Testament interpretations have been reduced to subpoints in a
               single, controlling view of the atonement. Tragically, the way in
               which the atonement is frequently and popularly expressed now
               poses a new scandal, one that is foreign to the New Testament and
               poses needless obstacles to twenty-first century peoples and
               cultures. At the heart of this book is a challenge for us to view
               afresh the variety of contextual understandings of the death of
               Christ in the New Testament and to reconsider how we can
               faithfully communicate with fresh models the atoning significance
               of the cross for specific contexts today. The authors explore how
               the atonement has been understood within a variety of
               contemporary contexts--both Western and non-Western--and show how
               we can enter into the thoroughly Christian mission of restating
               the saving scandal of the cross in our multicultural world of the
               twenty-first century.",

               nearly 120 extant writings, from his brief tractates to his
               prodigious theological works. For many readers, this volume is
               the only source for commentary on the numerous works by Augustine
               not available in English. Other articles discuss: Augustine's
               influence on other theologians, from contemporaries like Jerome
               and Ambrose to prominent figures throughout church history, such
               as Gregory the Great, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Harnack;
               Augustine's life, the chaotic political events of his world, and
               the church's struggles with such heresies as Arianism, Donatism,
               Manicheism, and Pelagianism; Augustine's thoughts about
               philosophical problems (time, the ascent of the soul, the nature
               of truth), theological questions (guilt, original sin, free will,
               the Trinity), and cultural issues (church-state relations, Roman
               society).",

  title     = "The Father's Will: Christ's Crucifixion and the Goodness of God",
  author    = "Lombardo, Nicholas E",
  publisher = "OUP Oxford",
  abstract  = "The night before his crucifixion, in the garden of Gethsemane,
               Jesus asks his Father to take away the cup of his suffering, but
               then says, ``not my will, but yours, be done.'' Shortly
               afterward, Judas arrives, and his arrival reveals something
               important about the Father's will. Yet much remains obscure. The
               sheer fact of Christ's crucifixion shows only that God was not
               willing to spare his Son. It does not shed any light on the
               positive content of the Father's will. Drawing on philosophical
               analysis and historical-critical exegesis, The Father's Will sets
               out to clarify the Father's will for Christ and how it relates to
               his death on the cross. Then, after considering the theologies of
               Anselm and Peter Abelard, it argues for the recovery of the early
               Christian category of ransom. Since Christians look to the
               crucifixion to make sense of their suffering, the Father's will
               for Christ relates to many existential questions; it also shapes
               the place of God the Father in Christian theology and culture.
               Interpreting the crucifixion as a ransom makes the goodness of
               God more evident. It also makes it easier to see God the Father
               as the author of our salvation, rather than a stern judge who
               must be placated. And since the category of ransom traces back to
               Jesus' saying in the Gospels about giving his life äs a ransom
               for many,¨it has great claim to interpret the crucifixion in the
               way Jesus himself interpreted it.",

               suffering in light of the work of Jamaican theologian Lewin
               Williams. It demonstrates that Williams rejects notions that
               suffering is a result of sin (just deserts) or is incapable of
               being grasped due to its meaningless nature (just desert). Human
               beings do not live in a just world, but in a tragic one. A tragic
               vision does not attempt to penetrate the opacity of evil by
               providing justifications of suffering. Rather, it recognizes that
               certain kinds of suffering are irredeemably unjust. Yet, unlike
               explanations that incorporate just deserts or just desert, a
               tragic sense burns strongly with a desire for justice, but burns
               even more fiercely with anger and pity at suffering. Suffering is
               at the core of tragedy and, according to Wendy Farley, “it
               witnesses to the power of absurdity or malice or sheer force to
               bring down what is noble and good.” Tragic vision reminds us that
               actions are performed in a context that is already tainted,
               disguised, lacking in moral neutrality, and even malevolent. In
               the end, the answer is not a theodicy but rather theodices, as
               one answer is not sufficient. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

               did not originate with Calvin, but was taught by the church
               fathers. A survey is presented of the writings of Justin Martyr,
               Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzus, Ambrose, and
               Augustine's respective understandings of the atonement,
               understood within their larger soteriology. From this it is
               concluded that the church fathers did not teach penal
               substitution; rather the dominant pattern found in these
               patristic writers is substitutionary atonement understood within
               the conceptual framework of restorative rather than retributive

               'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic'
               Trinity, is used by many but understood by few. Nonetheless,
               Thomas Weinandy's new conception of the Trinity, in which 'the
               Father begets the Son in or by the Holy Spirit', is developed on
               the basis of a thorough application of this axiom. The present
               article seeks to understand what the axiom entails and thus the
               security of any model of the Trinity developed through its use.
               Attention is paid to the relationship between the biblical basis
               of the doctrine of the Trinity and this doctrine itself. We
               conclude that Weinandy's use of Rahner's axiom leaves room for
               the incomprehensibility or mystery of God, but that Weinandy's
               theory runs the risk of being too confident about the nature of
               inter-Trinity relations. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

              revelation and grace to the necessary functioning of his
              ontological principles; thus confusing the object of philosophical
              reflection (absolute being) with the object of theological
              reflection (the triune God acting ad extra). The result is both
              the elimination of the need to believe in the triune God before

               adversary's attack, or an insidious internal theological problem.

               more pastors and church leaders than you can count. What a
               gift!''--John Ortberg, bestselling author Every church is driven
               by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities,
               events, seekers, and even buildings can each be the controlling
               force in a church. But Rick Warren believes that in order for a
               church to be healthy it must become a purpose-driven church,
               built around the five New Testament purposes given to the church
               by Jesus. ``The issue is church health, not church growth!''
               declares Warren. ``If your church is healthy, growth will occur
               naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing
               the five biblical purposes of the church.'' Rick Warren shares a
               proven five-part strategy that will enable your church to grow -
               warmer through fellowship - deeper through discipleship -
               stronger through worship - broader through ministry - larger
               through evangelism The Purpose Driven(R) Church shifts the focus
               away from church building programs to emphasizing a
               people-building process. Warren says, ``If you will concentrate
               on building people, God will build the church.''",

               third phase of the International Roman-Catholic-Reformed Dialogue
               might be the suggestion to reflect upon the idea of the church as
               'sacrament of the kingdom' (no.231). In this contribution, I
               shall take up that suggestion and develop a fourfold approach of
               the sacraments in which the interconnectedness of church and
               kingdom plays a crucial role. I shall deal with the
               soteriological, the ecclesiological, the eschatological and the
               symbolic aspect respectively. Deliberately, I begin with the
               soteriological aspect because the first and main thing sacraments
               do is to point to our salvation. Salvation implies, however, a
               mediation of salvation and hence the ecclesiological aspect
               follows the soteriological aspect. The mediation of the church
               always points beyond itself to the kingdom of God. That is the
               eschatological aspect. And every reference to the eschaton always
               has the form of the symbol as the focal point of the 'already'
               and 'not yet' character of the kingdom of God. We label that as
               the symbolic aspect. My conclusion will be that the fruitfulness
               of the suggestion to speak about the church as 'sacrament of the
               kingdom' depends on the preparedness to reap the results of the
               ecumenical discussions since Vatican II.",

               of the source of mission from an ecclesio- or anthropocentric
               source to a theocentric source, the Triune Godhead. This was a
               major (and contested) theological advance. This article explores
               some of the implications of missio Dei theology for the church.
               Problems and developments with the concept are examined in the

  abstract  = "At a time in which the very word church sounds a tone of dull
               irrelevance, the doctrine of the church has suffered the studied
               neglect of many Christian leaders. The persistent demands to
               market, manage and grow the church and to meet the felt needs of
               churched and unchurched all threaten to quench theological
               reflection on the abiding nature and mission of the church. But
               few activities bear greater promise as a starting point for
               renewing and reshaping the Christian church than the work of
               theology. In this book Edmund Clowney takes up that task,
               addressing along the way a variety of contemporary concerns:
               worship, mission, church and culture, church and state, church
               order and discipline, the ministry of women, baptism and the
               Lord's Supper, tongues and prophecy, signs and wonders. He draws
               on decades of thinking and teaching about the church as well as
               from his committed leadership and ministry within the church.
               Biblical, historical, systematic and Reformed, The Church is a
               timely and provocative reflection on the life, order and purpose

               its adaptability to the modern world system; yet, the way in
               which adaptability “works” is not well theorized. Hannah Arendt’s
               analysis of “the private and public realm” and Ulrich Beck’s
               description of “individualization and self-culture” offer
               heuristic frameworks for understanding how prosperity theology is
               well-suited to macro-historical patterns that address the growing
               individualization of everyday life, especially in relation to
               uncertain career paths and risk-oriented work structures.
               Arendt’s and Beck’s theoretical conceptualizations move away from
               sect-like notions of Pentecostals cultivating a bounded system
               among the non-Spirit-filled natives. Instead, their theoretical
               conceptualizations reveal Pentecostalism — especially in its
               prosperity orientation — to be fully compatible with
               individualization processes experienced by and demanded from
               today’s workers. A case study of the ministry of Oasis Christian
               Center to Hollywood entertainment industry workers illustrates
               connections between the Prosperity/Word of Faith orientation of
               the congregation and overarching processes of individualization.",

              identify systemic barriers to children meeting fruit and vegetable
              (FV) guidelines and generate sustainable actions within a local
              community to improve children's FV intake. A qualitative system
              dynamics method of community group model building was used. The
              research team partnered with Healthy Families Waitākere, a
              Ministry of Health funded prevention initiative, to recruit 17
              participants (including students, parents, teachers, community
              leaders, local retailers and health promoters) from a low-income,
              ethnically-diverse community in West Auckland, New Zealand. Three
              group model building workshops were held during which a systems
              map was created and used to identify actions by considering causal
              pathways and reinforcing loops in the system. Barriers to
              children's FV intake identified by participants were the
              saturation of fast-food outlets in the community and ubiquitous
              marketing of these products, the high cost of fresh produce
              compared to fast food, and parents having little time for food
              preparation plus declining cooking skills and knowledge. Several
              actions to improve children's FV intake by improving the local
              food environment were identified, which will be co-designed
              further and tested by a collaborative group involving community
              leaders. This project highlights the effectiveness of group model
              building for engaging a local community in systems change to
              improve child nutrition, and supplies a blueprint for future

              the atonement theology of the New Testament (NT), but it has not
              been proved by the NT. The purpose of this article is to
              investigate all verses in the NT that are alleged to refer to
              Abraham’s offering of Isaac. The reflections of Genesis 22 in the
              NT verses do not grant atoning power to the sacrifice of Isaac.
              Abraham’s portrait suggests Christ as the Beloved Son, but the
              vicarious death of Jesus on the Cross is unrelated to Isaac in
              Genesis 22. Isaac is the type of Christ only in the preparation of
              death. Jesus as the Tamid lamb (not as the Paschal lamb) refers to
              Genesis 22 without granting expiation of sin by Isaac. The
              resurrection motif as well as the promise-fulfilment scheme
              referring to Genesis 22 also does not validate the Aqedah. Thus,

               beginnings and a foundational sourcebook for biblical theology.
               He begins with exegesis of the Hebrew text, highlighting the
               recurrence of key words, phrases, and themes throughout the book.
               He also draws attention to passages particularly pertinent to
               earlier readers either facing or returning from exile, offering a
               historical context outside a solely Christian perspective. The
               second half of the book unpacks the numerous theological horizons
               of Genesis -- main unifying themes (descendants, blessing, land);
               key theological teachings of Genesis (creation, fall, character
               and image of God, life of faith); and the contribution of Genesis
               to theology today, including its impact on science, ecology, and
               feminist theology. McKeown's Genesis provides a solid examination
               of a scriptural book that reflects the struggles and hopes of its
               readers -- ancient and modern -- and offers encouragement for

               argue that the Akedah presents not only an ethical question but
               also an ethical reply. But for the intervention of the angel,
               Abraham would have killed his son. Obedience to God take
               precedence over morality as humanly conceived. Yet, the angel of
               YHWH that appears to Abraham is a later addition to the text;
               thus, in the original narrative Abraham actually disobeys the
               divine command to slay his son, and sacrifices a ram instead.The
               first part of the book shows how the ``original'' version of the
               narrative did not contain the angelic figure. The second part of
               the book re-examines various religious interpretations of the
               text to show that exegetes such as Maimonides and his followers
               did point out Abraham's disobedience. According to these writers

               disobedience to God's command was Abraham's true affirmation of
               faith. In the third part of the book, Boehm re-opens the
               philosophical debate between Kant and Kierkegaard. Boehm
               concludes the book by contending that the monotheistic model of

               a central but largely overlooked theme in both Judaism and
               Christianity, celebrated in biblical texts on Isaac, Ishmael,
               Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus. In this highly original book, Jon D.
               Levenson explores how this notion of child sacrifice constitutes
               an overlooked bond between the two religions. Levenson argues
               that although the practice of child sacrifice was eradicated
               during the late seventh and sixth centuries B.C.E, the idea of
               sacrificing the first-born son (or the late-born son whose
               preferential treatment promotes him to that exalted rank)
               remained potent in religious literature. Analyzing texts from the
               ancient Near East, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and
               rabbinic literature, Levenson shows how tales of the son handed
               over to death by his loving father in the Hebrew Bible influenced
               the Church's identification of Jesus as sacrificial victim.
               According to Levenson, the transformation of the idea of child
               sacrifice was central to the accounts given by the people Israel
               and the early Church of their respective origins, and it also
               underlay the theologies of chosenness embraced, in their
               differing ways, by the two religions. Furthermore, the
               longstanding claim of the Church that it supersedes the Jews,
               says Levenson, both continues and transforms elements of the old
               narrative pattern in which a late-born son dislodges his
               first-born brothers. Levenson's book, which offers novel
               interpretations of several areas crucial to biblical studies,
               will be essential reading for scholars in the field.",

               discovers the Jewish side to a debate that, until now, has not

               primarily after the death of Jesus when the early Jesus

               and actions of evangelical groups are founded upon their
               conceptions of Jesus Christ, Heltzel contends. He traces the
               roots of contemporary evangelical politics to the prophetic black
               Christianity tradition of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the
               socially engaged evangelical tradition of Carl F. H. Henry.
               Heltzel shows that the basic tenets of King's and Henry's
               theologies have led their evangelical heirs toward a prophetic
               evangelicalism in a shade of blue green--blue symbolizing the
               tragedy of black suffering in the Americas, and green symbolizing
               the hope of a prophetic evangelical engagement with poverty,
               AIDS, and the environment. This fresh theological understanding
               of evangelical political groups shines new light on the ways
               evangelicals shape and are shaped by broader American culture.",

  abstract  = "Churches of all types around the country are struggling. The more
               programs they try the more evident it becomes that there is no
               quick fix or secret formula to help them out of their rut. John
               Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Movement, once said, ``The
               way to keep a Methodist alive is to keep him moving.'' It is time
               to recapture this simple yet profound truth and get back to the
               basics of making fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ. The
               authors developed and launched a highly successful pathway to
               discipleship in their church (Morning Star UMC, in St.Louis).
               Here, they show others how to create a successful discipleship
               pathway for their own particular contexts, based on the
               principles developed at Morning Star. Willard and Schreiner share
               the process of developing a discipleship pathway that meets
               individual people where they are. They provide examples of each
               element and practical instruction on how to plan, implement and
               sustain the discipleship pathway. The authors are teaching this
               material in conferences around the UM connection, from New Mexico
               to Missouri. They also share examples of how the pathway works in
               other churches. For small group study participants working

               contemporary readers who wish to use the sermon as the standard
               by which they live their lives every day. Matera shows how the
               Sermon on the Mount summons believers to single-minded devotion
               and wholehearted service to God. He unfolds the historical and
               theological background to the sermon. He explores the meaning of
               the individual Beatitudes, which articulate Jesus' call for a
               more abundant righteousness, piety without hypocrisy, and the
               need to become ``doers'' of the Word. This lively and engaging
               commentary is an ideal resource for adult education and Bible

               therefore and make disciples of all nations'' (Matt 28:19). This
               being the case, shouldn't we be concerned with gaining a full
               understanding of discipleship from the entire New Testament
               corpus? Many scholars recognize that the theme of discipleship is
               found throughout the New Testament, even in Revelation, with all
               of its symbolism and bizarre imagery. But how does it do this?
               The focus of this study, through the use of content analysis
               methodology, is to demonstrate that the theme of discipleship is
               not only found in the Apocalypse, but is also exceedingly
               relevant for Christians today. In many parts of the world Jesus'
               disciples are facing opposition and persecution for their
               testimony to Jesus Christ. It would do Christians well to read
               the book of Revelation once again. As they read it this time
               through the eyes of the oppressed, the content of the book will
               prove extremely valuable to aid disciples of Jesus in their
               efforts to ``follow the Lamb wherever he goes'' (Rev 14:4), no

  publisher = "Liturgical Press",
  abstract  = "Vatican II’s famous declaration that ``the church on earth is by
               its very nature missionary” has often been taken out of context
               and used to support all manner of church initiatives. But, the
               conclusion of the statement—''since . . . it has its origin in
               the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit``—is of monumental
               importance. In The Way of Discipleship, theologian Anthony
               Gittins describes the eternal mission of the Trinity,
               historically brought ''down to earth`` in the ministry of Jesus,
               and then continued to the ends of the earth by those called and
               sent as disciples throughout future generations. Gittins explains
               that Christian discipleship must be the living out of Jesus' own
               example in many different times and places. He encourages people
               of all ages to follow the invitation of Jesus to be missionary
               disciples. The Way of Discipleship explores several New Testament
               examples of Jesus' call and commissioning, distills the
               principles involved, and then recontextualizes the stories so
               that they pose a direct challenge to disciples today. In this
               way, Gittins builds up a picture both of ''the Way`` of Jesus
               himself, and of the way in which today's disciples can loyally
               follow his call to mission.",

              shape Christology and subsequently Christian discipleship.
              Christification is articulated as the process by which individuals
              or groups, inside or outside the church and marked by
              displacement, marginalisation or persecution, are recognised as
              bearing Christ's presence in a special way. Those christified
              share in Christ's revelatory, soteriological and sanctifying role
              for the community who encounter, serve and learn from them. This
              illuminates the ethical and missional impact of christification.
              Taking Jon Sobrino's argument that Christology must take into
              account the historically received texts about Christ and the
              reality of Christ in the present, I argue that Christology cannot
              be complete without a transformative encounter with the
              christified least. For those in places of privilege, Christologies
              employing christification have an immediate effect on
              discipleship, locating the presence of Christ in the least amongst
              their community. For the marginalised, christification grants
              agency; seen as the embodiment of Christ, they facilitate
              revelation and shape ethical engagement. Attention is paid
              throughout the paper to how christification, as modelled
              particularly by theologians writing from or for marginalised or
              migrant communities, could be applied to my own Australian
              context, particularly current debates around refugees and

               from social and political concerns due to, amongst other things,
               a dual emphasis on personal salvation and individual
               discipleship. In this paper, I suggest that far from simply being
               an inwardly ecclesial occupation, the process of ?making
               disciples? is a political activity that impacts public life, that
               is the life of communities and nations. While some Pentecostals
               may be reluctant to see discipleship in political terms, I will
               argue that the history of the movement testifies to the work of
               the Spirit as being political. I will suggest that in
               Pentecostalism we see a political movement of the Spirit that
               opposes unjust structures within the church in order to usher in
               spiritual, social and political liberation for those beyond the
               church. I will consider the unique contributions Pentecostalism
               makes to political engagement through its development of
               conscious leaders and disciples from typically underprivileged
               communities. I will end with a reflection on facing conflict
               particularly in the area of ethnic and cultural difference which
               continues to be a theological and political challenge for

               self concepts has led to an overly dichotomized view of Eastern
               sociocentric selves ``versus'' Western individualistic selves.
               While most anthropologists agree on the need for a richer
               theoretical understanding of the self beyond the bipolar
               ego/sociocentric model, few theorists have suggested ways in
               which this model could be improved upon, especially on the
               Western side of the dichotomy. Although many anthropologists are
               beginning to break down the homogenous constructs of the
               sociocentric self in Eastern societies they study, this has not
               yet been rigorously attempted in the West. In this article, I
               focus on some of the problems with the dichotomy, with particular
               emphasis on problems on the Western ``side''--namely, the
               assumption that individualism precludes sociocentrism, the
               tendency to equate the West with America, the misrepresentation
               of the Western philosophical tradition, the homogenization of
               Western individualism, and the re-creation of the
               ego/sociocentric dichotomy within the West along gender and class
               lines. Finally, questions posed by social psychologists engaged
               in the individualism/collectivism debate, as well as examples
               from my own research on child rearing in Manhattan and Queens
               (Kusserow 1999), suggest ways in which conceptions of the Western
               self must be complexified.]",

              study employs a canonical-linguistic approach combined with a
              web-like approach, and argues that the canonical placement of Isa
              32:9–20 in its present literary position is hermeneutically and
              theologically significant within its co-texts (28–33), at a
              sectional level (1–39 and 40–66), and at the book level (1–66).
              Within its co-texts, Isa 32:9–20 functions to promote the theme
              that Yahweh is trustworthy to provide peace and well-being for
              those who put their trust in him amidst the imperial threat of the
              Assyrians. At the book level, Isa 32:9–20 functions as a mirror
              text, harking back to Yahweh’s plan to establish his kingdom of
              righteousness through his [Hebrew characters omitted], which will
              empower a Davidic agent (11:1–5; cf. 8:23–9:6; 16:1–5; 28:5–6;
              32:1–8), and looking forward to an era when Yahweh’s [Hebrew
              characters omitted] will no longer be confined to a Davidic agent
              but will be available to the entire people of God (32:15). This
              anticipation paves the way for the Spirit-filled servant(s)
              (individual and/or collective) who function as Yahweh’s faithful
              agents in Isa 40-66 (42:1–9, 44:1–5; 61:1–11; cf. 48:16b; 59:21),
              whose identities are defined not in terms of ethnicity but in
              terms of obedience and submission to Yahweh’s kingship. Thus, the
              prophet’s eschatological vision in Isa 32:9–20 functions to
              advocate the theme that Yahweh, the supreme King over the nations
              and creation, is sovereign in working out his salvific plan
              through the global mission of his [Hebrew characters omitted],
              which empowers not only a Davidic agent (Isa 1–39) but also the
              entire people of God to participate in the establishment of
              Yahweh’s kingdom of righteousness in Zion that extends to the
              whole world, encompassing the servant(s) in Isa 40–66 and readers
              in all ages who are willing to submit to Yahweh’s kingship.",

  abstract = "The prophetic books represent nearly one-third of the Old
              Testament, yet many pastors avoid preaching from the prophets
              because of the difficulty of understanding these passages or
              because of a perceived lack of relevance in these texts. As a
              result, many worshippers rarely hear a message from the prophets
              today. However, Paul includes the prophetic books in his statement
              that all Scripture is inspired by God and useful for training in
              righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16). Therefore, preachers have an
              obligation to preach from all areas of Scripture, not just
              sections with which they are comfortable. The purpose of this
              research project was to measure cognitive and affective changes in
              the worship participants of Ross Christian Church during a
              seven-week sermon series from the book of Isaiah. This study
              utilized an explanatory, mixed-methods design to measure
              quantitative and qualitative changes in the participants'
              knowledge of and affective responses to seven major themes of
              Isaiah's message. The findings reflect a strong interest among
              participants in understanding Isaiah's message and in learning how
              to apply that message to their lives. Additionally, participants'
              knowledge of and affective responses to Isaiah's themes increased
              slightly as a result of hearing this sermon series. These findings
              suggest that pastors who learn how to demonstrate the relevance of
              the prophets' message will improve their preaching and strengthen
              their congregations.",

  address  = "Ann Arbor",
  abstract = "This dissertation concerns the intersection between the New
              Testament use of the Old Testament, hermeneutics, and ethics in
              Paul’s use of Isaiah’s servant prophecy. After setting out the
              need for this study, the first stage of the research examines the
              verses in their original Masoretic context and demonstrates that
              Isaiah’s servant prophecies are tightly integrated into their
              context to form one broad prophetic arc. This arc promises that a
              servant will save people from sin through his victorious death and
              ensuing work through his followers and thus bring them into God’s
              new creation; it is therefore truly a salvation history. The
              second stage of the research considers the extant Second Temple
              interpretations of these verses, especially by Isaiah’s Septuagint
              translator. In each case the author’s conception of history is
              shown to warrant both the choice and use of the particular verses.
              The third stage considers Paul’s use of Isaiah’s Servant prophecy
              in Romans, 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. With respect to
              hermeneutical warrant, Paul uses the texts of Isaiah in line with
              its salvation history, which he argues has reached its fulfilment
              in the death of Christ and the ensuing proclamation of the gospel.
              More than this, Paul’s own union with Christ also warrants his
              application of several of these texts to his own life and
              ministry—especially from Isa 49—as Jesus Christ the servant
              continues to discharge his work of the proclamation of the gospel
              to the nations through his servant Paul. With respect to his
              ethics, Paul uses Isaiah’s prophecy of the servant to define the
              place of and the relationships between God, Jesus, himself, his
              Christian hearers, gentiles who have not heard the message of the
              gospel, Jews, and all those who refuse to obey the gospel by
              trusting its message and messenger. Paul draws both general and
              specific ethical entailments on the basis of these relationships.
              This suggests, therefore, that Paul does work with an
              indicative-imperative ethic, although the indicative side of the
              construal must be salvation-historically shaped to do justice to
              the way in which Paul conceives of ethics for both himself and his
              hearers.",

               and the Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching in particular,
               is pivotal in showing the way in which the fathers of the church
               interpreted scripture and distilled doctrine. The Demonstration
               is an important hinge showing how the doctrine of the fourth
               century with its definitive councils and definitions of faith,
               opens out from the new testament apostolic and evangelical
               witness. Presenting the full translation of the Demonstration of
               Irenaeus by Dean Armitage Robinson, this book offers a detailed
               theological commentary by Canon Iain MacKenzie on this
               foundational doctrinal text. MacKenzie sets out the main
               theological themes throughout Irenaeus' work, and explores his
               method of systematic theology, Athanasius's dependence on
               Irenaeus, and Irenaeus' influence on doctrine in the fourth
               century - particularly the works of Athanasius, Basil of
               Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa. Highlighting
               the importance of this second century theologian for theology
               today, this commentary and theological interpretation offers an
               incentive to study Irenaeus in the wider development of Christian
               doctrine as a cardinal figure in the appreciation of systematic
               theology.",

               shows how the religion emerged from its ancestral homeland in

               then expanded from there to the rest of the world. While giving a

               how Christianity attempts to reconcile with the teachings of
               Christ some of its stances on armed conflict, justice, and
               dominion. The Christian World is a remarkable testament to how

  abstract  = "The English Reformation was not a specific event which may be
               given a precise date; it was a long and complex process. ‘The
               Reformation’ is a colligatory concept, a historians’ label which
               relates several lesser changes into an overall movement: it
               embraces a break from the Roman obedience; an assertion of
               secular control over the Church; a suppression of Catholic
               institutions such as monasteries and chantries; a prohibition of
               Catholic worship; and a protestantization of services, clergy and
               laity. Though the political decision to introduce each phase of
               change and the legislative alteration of statutes and canons may
               be dated easily enough, it is much harder to ascribe
               responsibility and motive for such measures. Moreover, as the
               interest of historians has in recent years moved on from such
               political issues towards the administrative enforcement of new
               rules and popular acceptance of new ideas, so the identification
               and explanation of change have become even more difficult: the
               pace is likely to have varied from area to area, and the criteria
               by which progress should be measured are far from clear. It is
               therefore not surprising that there has been much dispute over
               the causes and chronology of developments in religion, and recent
               interpretations of the Reformation in England can, with some
               simplification, be grouped in relation to two matrices. One
               matrix relates to the motive force behind the progress of
               Protestantism: at one extreme, it could be suggested that
               Protestant advance was entirely the result of official coercion,
               while at the other it could be said that the new religion spread
               horizontally by conversions among the people. The second matrix
               relates to the pace of religious change: on the one hand, it
               could be suggested that Protestantism made real progress at an
               early date and had become a powerful force by the death of Edward
               VI, while on the other it could be said that little had been
               achieved in the first half of the century and the main task of
               protestantizing the people had to be undertaken in the reign of
               Elizabeth. These two matrices provide us with four main clusters
               of interpretations.",

               history and the historiography of the Reformation in England and
               in Germany. Late Monasticism and the Reformation contains an
               edition of a poignant chronicle from the eve of the Reformation
               and a new collection of essays. The first part of the book is a
               reprint of his edition of The Chronicle of Butley Priory, only
               previously available in a small privately financed edition which
               has long been out of print. The last English monastic chronicle,
               it extends from the early years of the sixteenth century up to
               the Dissolution. Besides giving an intimate portrait of the
               community at Butley, it reveals many details concerning the local
               history and personalities of Suffolk during that period. The

               concern such areas of current interest as the strength and

               the place of anticlericalism in the English Reformation; and

  abstract  = "Twenty years ago, historians thought they understood the
               Reformation in England. Professor A. G. Dickens's elegant The
               English Reformation was then new, and highly influential: it
               seemed to show how national policy and developing reformist
               allegiance interacted to produce an acceptable and successful
               Protestant Reformation. But, since then, the evidence of the
               statute book, of Protestant propagandists and of heresy trials
               has come to seem less convincing, Neglected documents, especially
               the records of diocesan administration and parish life, have been
               explored, new questions have been asked - and many of the answers
               have been surprising. Some of the old certainties have been
               demolished, and many of the assumptions of the old interpretation
               of the Reformation have been undermined, in a wide-ranging
               process of revision. But the fruits of the new 'revisionism' are
               still buried in technical academic journals, difficult for
               students and teachers to find and to use. There is no up-to-date
               textbook, no comprehensive new survey, to challenge the
               orthodoxies enshrined in older works. This volume seeks to
               fulfill two crucial needs for students of Tudor England. First,
               it brings together some of the most readable of the recent
               innovative essays and articles into a single book. Second, it
               seeks to show how a new 'revisionist' interpretation of the
               English Reformation can be constructed, and examines its
               strengths and weaknesses. In short, it is an alternative to a new
               textbook survey - until someone has time (and courage) to write
               one. The new Introduction sets out the framework for a new
               understanding of the Reformation, and shows how already published
               work can be fitted into it. The nine essays (one printed here for
               the first time) provide detailed studies of particular problems
               in Reformation history, and general surveys of the progress of
               religious change. The new Conclusion tries to plug some of the
               remaining gaps, and suggests how the Reformation came to divide
               the English nation. It is a deliberately controversial
               collection, to be used alongside existing textbooks and to
               promote rethinking and debate.",

               Abraham is the father of monotheistic religions, the great father
               willing to commit filicide at God's command. God's first mandate
               was: “Kill thy child, offer him up in sacrifice”. Without
               hesitating, Abraham gets ready to comply with the command and
               only at the very last moment, when he is ready to behead the
               child, God's voice reappears and says (No). Both the prescriptive
               and the proscriptive mandates converge in a single event. What
               explains this internal contradiction of the divine voice? Why
               does it order Abraham to sacrifice his beloved son? What is the
               function of the child in the sacrificial act?",

               character can keep us from achieving all we want to (or could)
               be. In Integrity, Dr. Cloud explores the six qualities of
               character that define integrity, and how people with integrity:
               Are able to connect with others and build trust Are oriented
               toward reality Finish well Embrace the negative Are oriented

               devotional use. The authors believe that we fail in the spiritual
               life mainly through neglect of the roles played by the various
               elements of our personality. They reflect on each of these
               elements - heart, mind, body, social life and soul - and invite
               us to understand its role, train it in new patterns, and expose
               it to God's transforming power. This holistic approach will, they
               suggest, produce new ways of responding to life, and will result
               in profoundly changed character. This accessible distillation of
               an award-winning work can be read as an ordinary book, or used

               Nestorius, the Bishop of Constantinople, and pronounced
               Nestorianism a christological heresy. The decisions of the

               (451 A.D.) and Fifth (553 A.D.) Ecumenical Councils. It must be
               said that “Nestorianism” as a special kind of doctrine could have
               been condemned as heretical could be called “dyoprosopatism.” But
               such was not the case. Nestorius was condemned and exiled as a
               heretic, and he was judged on the basis of certain doctrines

  abstract  = "This article suggests that the perplexities of Theodoret's
               Christology can be understood well if one regards them as
               stemming not from a doctrinal evolution (as some scholars argue),
               but rather from a fundamental (but usually unnoticed)
               inconsistency that is present at all times in Theodoret's life.
               The inconsistency lies between his normal pattern for writing
               about Christ and the way he sometimes writes of Christ when he is
               dealing with the crucifixion. Theodoret usually sees the personal
               subject of Christ (the one who acts and to whom the human
               experiences happen) as the Logos himself, but at times when he
               discusses the death of Christ, his strong view of divine
               impassibility leads him to see the personal subject who undergoes
               suffering and death as the man Jesus. The article substantiates
               its case by reviewing the most significant twentieth-century
               scholarly literature on Theodoret and by examining his
               christological writings from three different periods of his
               career: the years around the Council of Ephesus (431-3), the year
               he wrote the Eranistes (probably 447), and the years immediately

  abstract  = "Christianity, one of the world’s great religions, has had an
               incalculable impact on human history. This book, now the most
               comprehensive and up to date single volume work in English,
               describes not only the main ideas and personalities of Christian
               history, its organisation and spirituality, but how it has
               changed politics, sex, and human society. Diarmaid MacCulloch
               ranges from Palestine in the first century to India in the third,
               from Damascus to China in the seventh century and from San
               Francisco to Korea in the twentieth. He is one of the most widely
               travelled of Christian historians and conveys a sense of place as
               arrestingly as he does the power of ideas. He presents the
               development of Christian history differently from any of his
               predecessors. He shows how, after a semblance of unity in its
               earliest centuries, the Christian church divided during the next
               1400 years into three increasingly distanced parts, of which the
               western Church was by no means always the most important: he
               observes that at the end of the first eight centuries of
               Christian history, Baghdad might have seemed a more likely
               capital for worldwide Christianity than Rome. This is the first
               truly global history of Christianity.",

               outsiders who endanger public life. But is American culture
               really so neatly split between the religious and the secular? Is
               America as ``modern'' and is born-again Christian religious
               belief as ``pre-modern'' as many think? In the 1980s, born-again
               Christians burst into the political arena with stunning force.

               interaction with the public world. They claimed new cultural
               territory and refashioned themselves in the public arena. Here
               was a dynamic body of activists with an evangelical vision of
               social justice, organized under the rubric of the ``Moral
               Majority.'' Susan Harding, a cultural anthropologist, set out in
               the 1980s to understand the significance of this new cultural
               movement. The result, this long-awaited book, presents the most
               original and thorough examination of Christian fundamentalism to
               date. Falwell and his co-pastors were the pivotal figures in the
               movement. It is on them that Harding focuses, and, in particular,
               their use of the Bible's language. She argues that this language
               is the medium through which born-again Christians, individual and
               collective, come to understand themselves as Christians. And it
               is inside this language that much of the born-again movement took
               place. Preachers like Falwell command a Bible-based poetics of
               great complexity, variety, creativity, and force, and, with it,
               attempt to mold their churches into living testaments of the
               Bible. Harding focuses on the words--sermons, speeches, books,
               audiotapes, and television broadcasts--of individual preachers,
               particularly Falwell, as they rewrote their Bible-based tradition
               to include, rather than exclude, intense worldly engagement. As a
               result of these efforts, born-again Christians recast themselves
               as a people not separated from but engaged in making history. The
               Book of Jerry Falwell is a fascinating work of cultural analysis,
               a rare account that takes fundamentalist Christianity on its own
               terms and deepens our understanding of both religion and the
               modern world.",

               decline from a virtuous past and calls it to repentance and
               renewal. Employed by Americans of all political persuasions since
               the earliest days of settlement, the jeremiad has proven to be a
               powerful way of invoking the American past in order to chart a
               brighter American future. Part I of the book focuses on three
               especially important episodes in the jeremiad's history: early
               New England, Civil War America, and the rise of the Christian
               Right. Part II provides a critical analysis of the jeremiad's
               role in the American “culture wars” and politics more generally.
               In seeking to place the American past in the service of the
               American future, the book argues, the jeremiad takes not one
               form, but two: a traditionalist jeremiad whose view of the past
               depends heavily on claims about how things used to be, and
               emphasizes the importance of preserving concrete aspects of the
               past as we move toward an uncertain future; and a progressive
               jeremiad, which views the past as a repository of emancipatory
               principles articulated at the founding but never fully realized
               in practice. Acknowledging that both traditionalist and
               progressive jeremiads are deeply entwined with the nation's
               history, the book concludes with a call for a revived progressive
               jeremiad as most compatible with the deep diversity—cultural,
               religious, political, philosophical—that characterizes American
               society at the dawn of the twenty‐first century.",

               reflections on historical context, Murphy develops a compelling
               argument for how the jeremiad illuminates the messy complexity of
               the American relationship between religion and politics, broadly
               conceived. [...]the Puritan New England jeremiad served as an
               instrument of social cohesion and control, “an attempt to prod an
               oft quarreling and ever diversifying citizenry into a more
               unified whole and to direct that whole toward a specific
               political vision of New England's future” (38). Because the
               jeremiad is a call to action, an exhortation to reform the
               community back into the image of its founders and godly
               ancestors, there is the temptation to assume that the jeremiad is
               always a conservative political gesture. [...]Prodigal Nation is
               a wide-ranging and thoughtful meditation on how the
               theo-political stories we Americans tell ourselves resonate with

               place in Irenaeus’ theology, but that it poses no threat to his
               Trinitarian logic. I contend that two passages, previously

               refer to the reception of the Holy Spirit by the believer for his
               or her redemption. Moreover, I maintain two other passages do not

               Destroying Our Nation and Our Faith",
  author    = "Hendricks, Jr, Obery M",
  publisher = "Beacon Press",
  abstract  = "A timely and galvanizing work that examines how right-wing
               evangelical Christians have veered from an admirable faith to a
               pernicious, destructive ideology.Today’s right-wing Evangelical
               Christianity stands as the very antithesis of the message of
               Jesus Christ. In his new book, Christians Against Christianity,
               best-selling author and religious scholar Obery M. Hendricks Jr.
               challenges right-wing evangelicals on the terrain of their own
               religious claims, exposing the falsehoods, contradictions, and
               misuses of the Bible that are embedded in their rabid homophobia,
               their poorly veiled racism and demonizing of immigrants and
               Muslims, and their ungodly alliance with big business against the
               interests of American workers.He scathingly indicts the religious
               leaders who helped facilitate the rise of the notoriously
               unchristian Donald Trump, likening them to the “court jesters”
               and hypocritical priestly sycophants of bygone eras who
               unquestioningly supported their sovereigns’ every act, no matter
               how hateful or destructive to those they were supposed to
               serve.In the wake of the deadly insurrectionist attack on the US
               Capitol, Christians Against Christianity is a clarion call to
               stand up to the hypocrisy of the evangelical Right, as well as a
               guide for Christians to return their faith to the life-affirming
               message that Jesus brought and died for. What Hendricks offers is
               a provocative diagnosis, an urgent warning that right-wing
               evangelicals’ aspirations for Christian nationalist supremacy are
               a looming threat, not only to Christian decency but to democracy
               itself. What they offer to America is anything but good news.",

               In the very nature of the case the church is deeply concerned in
               this changing order. But what should be its relations with
               politics? How far may church and state mutually affect each
               other? An intelligent answer to such questions must spring from a
               knowledge of the history of the church's relations with political
               movements in the past. In the series of articles of which this is

              reconciles these two claims. I hypothesize that the time members
              of evangelical Protestant denominations spend in service to their
              church comes at the expense of participation in the wider
              community, contrary to the way mainline Protestant and Catholic
              churches foster civic activity among their members. However, I
              further hypothesize that the tight social networks formed through
              this intensive church activity can at times facilitate rapid and
              intense political mobilization. Data from the Citizen
              Participation Study supports the first hypothesis, while applying
              King's method of ecological inference to two elections in Alabama
              supports the second.",

  abstract  = "The Book of Martyrs by John Foxe written in the 16th century has
               long been the go-to source for studying the lives and martyrdom
               of the apostles. Whilst other scholars have written individual
               treatments on the more prominent apostles such as Peter, Paul,
               John, and James, there is little published information on the
               other apostles. In The Fate of the Apostles, Sean McDowell offers
               a comprehensive, reasoned, historical analysis of the fate of the
               twelve disciples of Jesus along with the apostles Paul, and
               James. McDowell assesses the evidence for each apostle’s
               martyrdom as well as determining its significance to the
               reliability of their testimony. The question of the fate of the
               apostles also gets to the heart of the reliability of the
               kerygma: did the apostles really believe Jesus appeared to them
               after his death, or did they fabricate the entire story? How
               reliable are the resurrection accounts? The willingness of the
               apostles to die for their faith is a popular argument in
               resurrection studies and McDowell offers insightful scholarly
               analysis of this argument to break new ground within the spheres
               of New Testament studies, Church History, and apologetics.",

               and social worlds. The oral performance of the prophetic word
               departs from a safe homeland for a tapestry of textual
               constructions in dangerous diaspora. Along the way it traffics in
               symbolic transformations for communities under siege. More
               specifically, written prophecy attends to survivors of war and as
               such functions as a resilient counter script, a meaning-making
               map of hope, for disoriented and dislocated people. As a sidebar,
               this essay considers the implications of this reading for
               contemporary Christian communions aligned with the state. Such an
               alignment creates a hermeneutical divide that may make the
               prophetic literature indecipherable.",

               learning to bear on this, the most complex book in the Hebrew
               Bible, unfolding its secrets to a new generation of students and
               scholars. Leading his readers with ease through the labyrinth of
               modern studies on the book, Stromberg keeps his eye firmly fixed
               on the most central compositional and theological issues at play.
               He consistently proves himself a reliable and sure-footed guide.
               He writes with clarity and accessibility, without falling into
               reductionism. What is more, Stromberg's articulation of Isaiah's
               multifaceted, intertwined theological arguments is a remarkable
               achievement, lucid and graceful. This is without doubt the best

  abstract  = "The study deals with the theological message and composition of
               the Book of Isaiah and promotes a thesis that an early Jewish
               reception history helps us to find perspectives to understand
               them. This study treats the following themes among others: 1
               Hezekiah as Immanuel was an important theme in the reception as
               can be seen in Chronicles and Ben Sira as well as in rabbinical
               writings. The central event which makes Hezekiah such an
               important figure, was the annihilation of the Assyrian army as
               recounted in Isaiah 36-37.2 The Book of Isaiah was interpreted in
               apocalyptic milieu as the Animal Apocalypse and Daniel show. Even
               though the Qumran writings do not provide any coherent way to
               interpret Isaianic passages its textual evidence shows how the
               community has found from the Book of Isaiah different concepts to
               characterize the division of the Jewish community to the
               righteous and sinful ones (cf. Isa 65-66).3 Ezra and Nehemiah
               received inspiration from the theological themes of Isaianic
               texts of Levitical singers which were later edited in the Book of
               Isaiah by scribes. The formation of the Book of Isaiah then went
               in its own way and its theology became different from that in the
               Book of Ezra-Nehemiah.",

               Isaiah, is one of the most important theological voices in the
               Bible. J. J. M. Roberts takes a classical historical-critical
               approach to his interpretation of this material, making good use
               of his broad comparative knowledge of ancient Near Eastern
               historical and religious sources. In light of Isaiahs very long
               prophetic ministry of at least thirty-eight years, and perhaps as
               long as fifty-three years, Roberts also suggests Isaiah often
               reedited older oracles from early in his ministry to address new,
               though somewhat analogous situations, albeit with different
               players, later in his ministry, without erasing telltale signs of
               the materials earlier origin. In many cases, this suggestion
               provides a better explanation for glaring inconsistencies in an
               apparently connected text than the common fragmentation of the
               text that attributes such inconsistencies to later editors who

               location in chapters 36–39 for ideological reasons, providing a
               link with exile presupposed in chapters 40–66. Without denying
               Isa 39’s connection with Isa 40–66, I show that Isa 39 also
               belongs to the motif of human trust prevalent in First Isaiah by
               tracking the triad “silver, gold, and treasures” in chapters 2,
               30–31, and 39. I further argue that chapter 39 was purposefully
               assigned its current literary location to round off First
               Isaiah’s political critique of foreign alliances. As a necessary
               implication, Isa 39 does not present a pious Hezekiah. Instead,
               First Isaiah ends with a paradigmatic negative version of the
               Davidic dynasty, highlighting its failure to trust YHWH as the
               main reason for the reality of exile. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

               from sound exegesis to the development of biblical and systematic
               theologies and to the preparation of sound, biblical sermons.

               context--a movement between the horizon of the text and the
               horizon of the reader that spirals nearer and nearer toward the
               intended meaning of the text and its significance for today.

               translation.Form/Structure/Setting—a discussion of redaction,

  abstract  = "Historical-critical scholars have often thought that writing a
               coherent theology of Isaiah 56-66 is impossible because it
               contains such historically and ideologically diverse materials. A
               canonical approach to the chapters is, however, open to
               considering Third Isaiah as a complex but coherent theological
               unity. Leaning on this approach, Abraham Oh constructs a theology
               of Isaiah 56-66. Arguing that the theology of Third Isaiah has
               eschatology (both prophetic and apocalyptic) at its core, he
               identifies four major themes and explores their significance
               through four key texts (56:1-8; 59:15b-21; 60:1-22; 65:13-25).
               The covenant concept (56:1-8) forms a framework for the
               eschatology in these chapters. People are invited to walk in the
               covenant, which is worked out as eschatological salvation. The
               coming of YHWH as the Divine Warrior initiates the eschatological
               era (59:15b-21) and, bringing judgment, restores the covenant. As
               the Temple-city-paradise (60:1-22) into which the nations flow,
               the glorified Zion is the eschatological fulfilment of the
               covenant, Zion, and Servant traditions. The New Heavens and Earth
               (65:13-25) is a return to the primordial paradise, where the
               natural world is restored, as the problem of sin is resolved.",

               the story of Adam and Eve has resonated richly through the
               corridors of art, literature and theology. But for most moderns,
               taking it at face value is incongruous. And even for many
               thinking Christians today who want to take seriously the
               authority of Scripture, insisting on a ``literal'' understanding
               of Genesis 2–3 looks painfully like a ``tear here'' strip between
               faith and science. How can Christians of good faith move forward?
               Who were the historical Adam and Eve? What if we've been reading
               Genesis—and its claims regarding material origins—wrong? In what
               cultural context was this couple, this garden, this tree, this
               serpent portrayed? Following his groundbreaking Lost World of
               Genesis One, John Walton explores the ancient Near Eastern
               context of Genesis 2–3, creating space for a faithful reading of
               Scripture along with full engagement with science for a new way
               forward in the human origins debate. As a bonus, an illuminating
               excursus by N. T. Wright places Adam in the implied narrative of
               Paul's theology. The Lost World of Adam and Eve will be required
               reading for anyone seeking to understand this foundational text
               historically and theologically, and wondering how to view it
               alongside contemporary understandings of human origins. The books
               in the Lost World Series follow the pattern set by Bible scholar

               Paul's understanding of the Holy Spirit, a topic that has rarely
               received sufficient attention in studies of Pauline theology.
               Fee's method is exemplary: he first analyzes Paul's statements
               about the Spirit, in each individual letter, and then moves to a
               synthesis of Paul's general pneumatology. The result is a book
               that is deeply exegetical, doing justice both to the
               particularity of Paul's writings and to the fundamental unity of
               his vision for the Spirit's role in the life of the Christian
               community. Most importantly, Fee emphasizes insistently that the
               Holy Spirit must be experienced as a living presence within the
               church. That message is both faithful to Paul and urgent for the
               community of faith in our time.''--Richard B. Hays, professor of
               New Testament, Duke University Divinity School``With the energy
               and care that is a trademark of his work, Gordon Fee here fills a
               significant gap in Pauline studies. Both those who find talk
               about the Holy Spirit congenial and those who would happily
               marginalize it will be instructed by this book. Fee makes a
               genuine contribution as he examines Paul's letters in
               conversation with both the exegetical tradition of the academy
               and the pressing needs of the church.''--Beverly R. Gaventa,
               professor of New Testament and exegesis, Princeton Theological
               Seminary``Fee uniquely combines professional competence as a text
               critic, an exegete, an author and editor of major commentaries,
               and a foremost evangelical interpreter of Paul with a lifetime of
               formation and ministry among the Pentecostals--this century's
               providential witnesses to the work of the Spirit of God among us.
               . . . Fee's work offers an enduring encyclopedia of Pauline
               pneumatological exegesis, easy to consult for next Sunday's
               sermon, yet substantial enough to take its place near George

  author    = "Grey, Jacqueline",
  publisher = "Wipf and Stock Publishers",
  abstract  = "Three's a Crowd brings together the three dialogue partners of
               Pentecostalism, hermeneutics, and the Old Testament. Previous
               attempts by Pentecostal academics to define a distinctive
               Pentecostal hermeneutic have focused on issues and application to
               the New Testament, consequently estranging the Old Testament from
               the conversation. This book engages the hermeneutical practices
               of Pentecostal and Charismatic groups in reading the Old
               Testament in ways that are representative, while critical, of
               their movement's ideological bases and visions. While the issue
               of understanding and developing a viable Pentecostal hermeneutic
               has continued to be debated within the academic journals of the
               community for over a decade, most discussion has focused on the
               prescription of ideals rather than on the actual practice of the
               contemporary community. By examining the reading practices of the
               Pentecostal and Charismatic community, this book suggests a
               unique and rounded reading method that maintains the strengths of
               Pentecostal reading practices while addressing their inherent
               weaknesses. In this way, the voices of the three dialogue
               partners emerge in a mutual fellowship that engages both the
               needs of the Pentecostal community and informs the wider
               ecumenical dialogue.",

               fuel the passion of anyone who ventures to write about God and

               Few themes call for as much of a blending of mind and heart as
               that of the Holy Spirit.The global spread of Pentecostal
               Christianity, often in context of urban poverty, has attracted
               much attention. The movement highlights a hunger for the
               experience of God in our world and provides millions of poor
               believers with hope for social transformation. Yet spiritual
               experience needs a fully biblical understanding of the Holy

               vital issues and questions, many of which have been, and continue

               Combining scholarly enquiry with accessibility, his deep

  abstract  = "Human trauma gave birth to the Bible, suggests eminent religious
               scholar David Carr. The Bible's ability to speak to suffering is
               a major reason why the sacred texts of Judaism and Christianity
               have retained their relevance for thousands of years. In his
               fascinating and provocative reinterpretation of the Bible's
               origins, the author tells the story of how the Jewish people and
               Christian community had to adapt to survive multiple catastrophes
               and how their holy scriptures both reflected and reinforced each
               religion's resilient nature.Carr's thought-provoking analysis
               demonstrates how many of the central tenets of biblical religion,
               including monotheism and the idea of suffering as God's
               retribution, are factors that provided Judaism and Christianity
               with the strength and flexibility to endure in the face of
               disaster. In addition, the author explains how the Jewish Bible
               was deeply shaped by the Jewish exile in Babylon, an event that
               it rarely describes, and how the Christian Bible was likewise
               shaped by the unspeakable shame of having a crucified savior.",

  author    = "Enns, Peter",
  publisher = "Brazos Press",
  abstract  = "Can Christianity and evolution coexist? Traditional Christian
               teaching presents Jesus as reversing the effects of the fall of
               Adam. But an evolutionary view of human origins doesn't allow for
               a literal Adam, making evolution seemingly incompatible with what
               Genesis and the apostle Paul say about him. For Christians who
               both accept evolution and want to take the Bible seriously, this
               can present a faith-shaking tension.Popular Old Testament scholar
               Peter Enns offers a way forward by explaining how this tension is
               caused not by the discoveries of science but by false
               expectations about the biblical texts. In this 10th anniversary
               edition, Enns updates readers on developments in the historical
               Adam debate, helping them reconcile Genesis and Paul with current
               views on evolution and human origins. This edition includes an
               afterword that explains Enns's own theological evolution since
               the first edition released.",

  title     = "Pentecostal Spirituality: A Passion for the Kingdom",
  author    = "Land, Steven Jack",
  publisher = "A\&C Black",
  abstract  = "In this classic book, leading Pentecostal scholar Steven J. Land
               offers a constructive and controversial interpretation, a
               're-vision', of the Pentecostal tradition. As Pentecostalism
               approaches its centennial, Land argues that the early years of
               the movement form the heart, not the infancy, of its
               spirituality, and he emphasizes the crucial importance of its
               Wesleyan, Holiness and nineteenth-century
               revivalist-restorationist roots. Land's foundational study
               includes - an account of the relationship of spirituality and
               theology - a description and analysis of Pentecostal beliefs and
               practices - a demonstration of how these beliefs and practices
               are integrated into Pentecostal affections - a trinitarian
               definition of Pentecostal Spirituality, arguing that a passion
               for the kingdom of God is ultimately a passion for God Himself",
